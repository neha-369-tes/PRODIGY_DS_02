# Titanic Dataset EDA

## Project Overview

This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to uncover insights into the factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.

## Key Components

### üîç Data Cleaning
- **Missing Values**: Addressed missing values to ensure data completeness.
- **Data Types**: Corrected data types for accurate analysis.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensured the integrity of the dataset, laying a solid foundation for subsequent analysis.

### üìà Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Variable Relationships**: Analyzed relationships between variables such as age, gender, and survival rates.
- **Visualization**: Created plots to visualize trends and patterns, highlighting the impact of class and gender on survival.
- **Insights**: Discovered complex interplays of factors affecting survival, providing meaningful insights into the dataset.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
